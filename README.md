# SeizureSense

Embedded System Project ICT 301 2.0

Overview

SeizureSense is a wearable seizure detection system designed to monitor and analyze movement patterns using an accelerometer. The system detects potential seizure events and provides real-time alerts, ensuring timely intervention for individuals with epilepsy.

How It Works
	•	The device utilizes an ADXL345 accelerometer to continuously track movement data.
	•	A machine learning model trained on seizure data classifies movement patterns in real time.
	•	If a seizure is detected, an alert is triggered and sent to caregivers.
	•	Data is logged for further analysis and potential model improvements.

Features

✅ Real-time motion monitoring
✅ Machine learning-based seizure detection
